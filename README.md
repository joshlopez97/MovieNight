# MovieNight
MovieNight is a web application for browsing and buying movies. The application consists of a [frontend](https://movienight.dev) and four different RESTful microservices: an IDM service, inventory service, billing service, and API gateway. All five of these components are built using Java, Gradle, Jackson, and Jersey. The service is deployed via NGINX for display purposes only at https://movienight.dev. This application is fully functioning, but is only built for demonstrative purposes.
