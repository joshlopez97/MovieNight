# MovieNight
MovieNight is a web application for browsing and buying movies. The application is composed of a frontend and four different RESTful microservices: an IDM service, inventory service, billing service, and API gateway. All five of these components are built using Java, Gradle, Jackson, and Jersey. The service is deployed via NGINX for display purposes only at https://movienight.dev. This service is fully functioning, but not designed to be used for any actual business.
